# MachineLearningInC

- Uses C to implement a machine learning algorithm and create a linear regression model for predicting house prices. It makes use of matrix multiplication, matrix transposing and a simplified gauss-jordan elimination to find the pseudo inverse of the matrix, for the purposes of computing the optimal weights based on the training data provided.
